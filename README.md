## ATTENTION ‚ö†Ô∏èüö®
Now there is a problem with pytube 15.0.0 I sugest to momentary use older versions of pytube such as 12.1.3 trought this command:

`pip3 install pytube==12.1.3`

if you really want to use the version 15.0.0 you must follow this guide https://github.com/pytube/pytube/issues/1712

## ATTENTION ‚ö†Ô∏èüö®
Now there is an issue with python 3.12.X on macOS system so if you have a macOS device you must use 3.11.8 or above
