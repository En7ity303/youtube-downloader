|----------|
This script is only for educational purpose, downloading YouTube video is AGAINST the YouTube's terms.
I hope you will understand python better with this simple script (if you are new like me, unless maybe you will cry seeing this code idk ;) ), I personally learned a lot trying to create it since i'm new on python, as you can se my previous project was in c++
